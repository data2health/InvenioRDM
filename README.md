# InvenioRDM

### Welcome!

InvenioRDM enables organizations to securely house research products and make them discoverable, shareable, and citable – from publications and presentations to datasets, software, lay summaries, policy documents, and guidelines. InvenioRDM is being developed as part of a large, multi-organization collaboration in partnership with the [European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)](https://home.cern/), birthplace of the World Wide Web and developers of the [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) RDM for the European community. Together we are working to build a wide range of features that can help power biomedical research and support data sharing, innovation, knowledge dissemination, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Our work is driven by user needs and informed by best practices and standards, including those that help define [Next Generation Repositories](http://ngr.coar-repositories.org/) as a foundation for a distributed, globally-networked infrastructure for scholarly communication, discovery, and innovation.

## An interdisciplinary open research repository

This project focuses on development of infrastructure to preserve and disseminate translational research more easily. The portal enhances visibility and access, promotes people and the attribution of their work, and supports open and FAIR-TLC science with good data practice workflows, powerful search and indexing, and privacy standards required for translational research.

## Problem Statement

Proper collection, indexing, and preservation is vital to the discovery and dissemination of research output in scientific research. However, many research communities continue to battle the problem of “silos” at the institutional level that hinder discovery of research output. We propose to build infrastructure that can be easily deployed and managed either locally or on a cloud-based platform to collect, record, preserve, and disseminate a wide range of digital works across the translational community to enhance their visibility, promote people and their expertise, support attribution of their work, aid the discovery and accessibility by the international scientific community, and support open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, & Reusable (FAIR) science. At the same time, we will use this tool to promote good data practice workflows, incorporate standards and persistent identifiers, and account for privacy standards required for translational research. 

## Project Description

Infrastructure that can be easily deployed and managed locally to collect, record, preserve, and disseminate a wide range of digital works across the translational workforce\* is critical to enhance their visibility, promote people and their expertise, support attribution of their work, aid the discovery and accessibility by the international scientific community, and support open and FAIR-TLC science. Such an initiative requires a trusted framework for digital objects, good data practice workflows; incorporation of standards and persistent identifiers; incorporation of privacy considerations, and strategies to support implementation and integration as well as incentivize individuals participating in such an ecosystem. Here we are developing an integrated, born-interoperable repository and data catalog to empower researchers as they engage in good data practices around research data management, licensing, preservation, credit, discovery, and reuse of these digital artefacts and data at their hubs. This next-generation repository is being built in partnership with CERN on their Invenio platform. Invenio is a a safe, secure, scalable, and RESTful architecture to power the repositories of CERN and many other organizations in a mature open source community. The software will be available for local level and implementation and we are working in parallel to make a cloud instance available for broad use.
