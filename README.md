## An interdisciplinary open research repository

This project focuses on development of infrastructure to preserve and disseminate translational research more easily. The portal enhances visibility and access, promotes people and the attribution of their work, and supports open and FAIR-TLC science with good data practice workflows, powerful search and indexing, and privacy standards required for translational research.

# Problem Statement

Proper collection, indexing, and preservation is vital to the discovery and dissemination of research output in scientific research. However, many research communities continue to battle the problem of “silos” at the institutional level that hinder discovery of research output. We propose to build infrastructure that can be easily deployed and managed either locally or on a cloud-based platform to collect, record, preserve, and disseminate a wide range of digital works across the translational community to enhance their visibility, promote people and their expertise, support attribution of their work, aid the discovery and accessibility by the international scientific community, and support open and FAIR-TLC science. At the same time, we will use this tool to promote good data practice workflows, incorporate standards and persistent identifiers, and account for privacy standards required for translational research. 

## Project Description

Infrastructure that can be easily deployed and managed locally to collect, record, preserve, and disseminate a wide range of digital works across the translational workforce* is critical to enhance their visibility, promote people and their expertise, support attribution of their work, aid the discovery and accessibility by the international scientific community, and support open and FAIR-TLC science. Such an initiative requires a trusted framework for digital objects, good data practice workflows; incorporation of standards and persistent identifiers; incorporation of privacy considerations, and strategies to support implementation and integration as well as incentivize individuals participating in such an ecosystem. Here we are developing an integrated, born-interoperable repository and data catalog to empower researchers as they engage in good data practices around research data management, licensing, preservation, credit, discovery, and reuse of these digital artefacts and data at their hubs. This next-generation repository is being built in partnership with CERN on their Invenio platform. Invenio is a a safe, secure, scalable, and RESTful architecture to power the repositories of CERN and many other organizations in a mature open source community. The software will be available for local level and implementation and we are working in parallel to make a cloud instance available for broad use.

## Repositories

This project is currently based in a private repository. Public version coming soon.

## Deliverables

* Version 1 of the repository with key first-round features, NGR updates (in progress and in collaboration), incorporation of metadata best practices (per CD2H), incorporation of attribution work to date, and other features.
* A local NU instance
* Cloud-based instance 
* GitHub repo where software can be downloaded, features requested, etc.
* Ongoing requirements gathering, landscape analysis, and testing - with results disseminated broadly
* Collaborations with other data catalog/repository stewards to identify shared priorities, opportunities for collaboration, and strategies to enable and support interoperability, data discovery, and sustainability and support for local projects.
* Engagement materials/activities (1-pager, demo video on YouTube, conference presentations, etc.)
* Roadmap for next phase of work.

## Milestones 
### In addition to the deliverables above...

* Feature parity with Galter Library's current repository (6 months)
* Addition of selected [next-generation repository features](http://ngr.coar-repositories.org/) (6 months - 1 year)
* Advanced features next-generation features (1 year +)

## Evaluation
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in GitHub using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
