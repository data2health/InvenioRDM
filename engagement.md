# Welcome to the menRva project #
Thanks for being interested in the work we are doing. We’re glad you’re here and look forward to your contributions. You don’t need to code to contribute to our project. At present, we are looking for your help in the following areas:

* Review/comment on our repository [competitive intelligence landscape](https://github.com/data2health/menRva/issues/77). Who should we include? What information do you want to share? 

* [Feedback/brainstorming](https://github.com/data2health/menRva/issues/76). What features do you want to see in a repository or data index?

* We will need pilot sites for our cloud-deployable version later this year. Interested in learning more? Email lisa dot okeefe at northwestern dot edu

If you don’t see exactly what you want to be doing, please know that as we progress in the project our needs will change. At some point our needs will become more technical.
